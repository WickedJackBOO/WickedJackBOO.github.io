    <p>This is how the nanites work on this page: they react to your mouse movements and clicks—left click attracts them, right click repels them, and hovering gently nudges them away.</p>

            <p><strong>Nanites</strong>, also called <strong>nanobots</strong> or <strong>nanorobots</strong>, are very tiny robots. They are so small you'd need a powerful microscope just to see them. How small exactly? Well, "<strong>nano</strong>" means one billionth, so a <strong>nanometer</strong> is one billionth of a meter. Imagine something <strong>thousands of times thinner than a human hair</strong>, and that's how tiny they are!</p>
            <p>These tiny machines often appear in science fiction stories. Examples you might know include the nanotech suits from <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, the building nanites from <em>Transcendence</em>, and the healing nanobots from <em>Bloodshot</em>. They are usually imagined as being made from <strong>atoms and molecules</strong>, or even biological parts like proteins or DNA. This allows them to build things and perform tasks at a very small level. This makes them not just <strong>really small</strong>, but also <strong>very powerful</strong>.</p>
            <p>Right now, <strong>real-world robots</strong> can't do the amazing things nanites do in movies, mainly because building something this small is incredibly hard. Scientists have made progress with simpler versions, such as nano-sized motors and tiny robots built from DNA for medicine, but truly free-roaming nanites are still experimental.</p>
            <p>If nanites ever become real, they could do jobs bigger robots can't. For example, they might work <strong>inside our bodies</strong>, giving medicine exactly where it's needed, fixing damaged cells, or clearing blocked areas. They could also work with <strong>special materials</strong> or inside <strong>tiny electronics</strong>.</p>
